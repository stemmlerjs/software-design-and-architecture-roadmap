# The Full-Stack Software Design and Architecture Roadmap

> How to learn software design and architecture

Below you'll find a big map for junior, self-taught and intermediate developers to learn more about software design and architecture. 

As a JavaScript turned strictly TypeScript developer, I realized that software design was a huge topic and I felt that I wasn't getting the most out of my object-oriented TypeScript.

I made this chart to mind map my process of learning software design and architecture over the past year; sharing them here so that the community can benefit from it as well.

> I wrote an article titled "[How to Learn Software Design and Architecture](https://khalilstemmler.com/articles/software-design-architecture/full-stack-software-design/)" where I dive into more details on each part of the stack [here](https://khalilstemmler.com/articles/software-design-architecture/full-stack-software-design/)! Check it out.

If you think that these can be improved in anyway, please do suggest.
